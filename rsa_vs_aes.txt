RSA (asymmetric encryption) uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
It is computationally slower but provides secure key exchange and digital signatures.
It is best used for protecting small amounts of data, such as encrypting symmetric keys.

AES-256 (symmetric encryption) uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption.
It is extremely fast and efficient for encrypting large files or continuous data streams.

Performance difference:
AES is much faster than RSA because it performs simpler mathematical operations.
RSA involves modular exponentiation and large integer arithmetic, which is slower.

Use-case difference:
RSA is used for secure key exchange, authentication, and digital signatures.
AES is used for bulk data encryption, such as securing files, databases, or communication channels.

In real-world systems, they are often combined:
RSA encrypts the AES key, and AES encrypts the actual data â€” this is called hybrid encryption.
